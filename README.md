# WebDriver-POM-BDD-Automation
## Bootrap Automated Testing project for web based application

This is the basic bootstrap project to start with the Automated Testing Framework for any web based project. 
It uses Selenium Web Driver in POM structure and topped with BDD using Cucumber.

## Getting Started

To start with framework building, you need to do following steps:
```
1. Environment Setup - Setup the development environment on the local machine by installing prerequisites.
2. Project Setup - Git Clone the WebDriver_POM_BDD_Automation repo on your local machine.
3. Writing Project's Automated Cases - Start writing Page Objects, Step definitions and Feature Files
4. Running Test - Run the mvn test, Simple... :)

```

### Environment Setup - Prerequisites

What things you need to install on you local machine.

```
1. Java 1.8 JDK
2. Eclipse - Code Editor (You can you other, then you need to have alternatives of next items.)
3. Eclipse plugins:
     a. Cucumber  - cucumber.eclipse.p2updatesite		    http://cucumber.github.io/cucumber-eclipse/update-site/
     b. Git       - EGit P2 Repository	                http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates-4.5/
     c. TestNG    - TestNG Eclipse Composite P2 Repo	  http://beust.com/eclipse
     d. Maven     - Project Dependency Manager		      http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases/
4. TBA
```

### Project Setup - Git Clone

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Writing Automated Test Cases - In defined code structure

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
