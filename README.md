# WebDriver-POM-BDD-Automation
## Bootrap Automated Testing project for web based application

This is the basic bootstrap project to start with the Automated Testing Framework for any web based project. 
It uses Selenium Web Driver in POM structure and topped with BDD using Cucumber.

## Getting Started

To start with framework building, you need to do following steps:
```
1. Environment Setup - Setup the development environment on the local machine by installing prerequisites.
2. Project Setup - Git Clone the WebDriver_POM_BDD_Automation repo on your local machine.
3. Writing Project's Automated Cases - Start writing Page Objects, Step definitions and Feature Files
4. Running Test - Run the mvn test, Simple... :)

```

### Environment Setup - Prerequisites

What things you need to install on you local machine.

```
1. Java 1.8 JDK
2. Eclipse - Code Editor (You can you other, then you need to have alternatives of next items.)
3. Eclipse plugins:
     a. Cucumber  - cucumber.eclipse.p2updatesite		    http://cucumber.github.io/cucumber-eclipse/update-site/
     b. Git       - EGit P2 Repository	                http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates-4.5/
     c. TestNG    - TestNG Eclipse Composite P2 Repo	  http://beust.com/eclipse
     d. Maven     - Project Dependency Manager		      http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases/
4. Download latest browser Drivers and put them in /usr/local/bin/
     a. Chromedriver
     b. Gheckodriver (Firefox)
     3. ...
```

### Project Setup - Git Clone

Now after Environment setup, we are ready for project setup.

In this step clone the repository
```
1. Git Clone the repository in eclipse (https://github.com/abkabhishek/WebDriver-POM-BDD-Automation.git) by using Git plugin.
2. Add the project in Eclipse's project explorer
3. Right click on the project in Project Explorer and update project through maven (maven > Update Project)
```

### Sample Run - mvn test

Now project is ready for the sample run with already existing example code using mvn command
```
mvn test
```
Below steps are TBD

### Writing Automated Test Cases - In defined code structure (TBD)

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to write automated test cases

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example (TBD)
```

And repeat (TBD)

```
until finished (TBD)
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system (TBD)

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment (TBD)

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With (TBD)

* Java - The Language
* Selenium - Automation Module to interact with browser
* POM - Structuring of Automated Code of application under test
* TestNG - for unittest
* Gherkin - Standard BDD format
* Cucumber - framework library for implementing Gherkin
* JUnit - for BDD runner
